# Backend Directory

This backend directory is not needed for ResumeGenie as it's a frontend-only application.

The app uses:
- Mock API services for demonstration
- Client-side resume analysis simulation
- No backend dependencies required

To run ResumeGenie, simply use the frontend commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
